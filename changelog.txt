Version: 0.0.4
Date: 04.12.2023
  Features:
    - Automatically generate electric-energy-interfaces for electric locomotives
    - Simplify some internal logic, slightly improving performance
  Bugfixes:
    - Handle on_entity_cloned to fix a crash when a locomotive was cloned
    - Fix a crash when removing a train that just changed state
    - Create data for existing locomotive entities that were not previously electric
  Compatibility:
    - Now compatable with Space Exploration's spaceships due to the on_entity_cloned fix. Space elevators already worked fine
    - The internal rails of SE's Space elevator are now powered (prevents a brief "train out of fuel" warning)
    - Compatability with SE Space Trains, makes them electric and removes the battery packs (both optional)
    - Recipe compatability with Brevven's resource mods (Lead, Tin, & Aluminum)

Version: 0.0.3
Date: 20.11.2023
  Features:
    - Distribute train updates across multiple ticks, updating each train every 6 ticks (rate is configurable)
    - Correctly unpower rails when a catenary pole is removed
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when LuaTrains were removed/created due to locomotive prototypes being removed
    - Fixed a filename issue with a wire sprite (?)
  Compatibility:
    - Marked catenary poles & transformer as not movable by Picker Dollies
    - Recipe consistency with AAI Industry
    - Move our items into the 'rail' subgroup that Space Exploration creates

Version: 0.0.2
Date: 18.11.2023
  Features:
    - Only locomotives that are accelerating consume power (including in manual mode)
    - Connecting catenary lines around curves
    - Multiple transformers per network, works with multi-surface electric networks
    - Rail power visualization & shortcut to toggle it
    - Update all locomotives in a train as a group

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 17.07.2023
  Features:
    - Electric locomotives (use power from catenary lines & disable when no power)
    - Basic catenary line functionality (doesn't work around curves yet)
    - Catenary line transformer (core entity of a catenary network)
    - Technologies and recipes for vanilla Factorio
  Graphics:
    - Lovely placeholder graphics by yours truly ;)
  Locale:
    - Added English translation
