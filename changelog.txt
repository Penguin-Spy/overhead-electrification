Version: 0.1.5
Date: 08.05.2024
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when loading with SE Space Trains and Attach Notes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4
Date: 02.03.2024
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when loading both SE Space Trains and Krastorio 2
  Compatibility:
    - Added compatability with Krastorio 2; rebalances the electric locomotive's stats to match Krastorio's changes, and tweaks recipes a bit

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 19.02.2024
  Features:
    - Made placement restrictions less strict for catenary poles, making pasting down a blueprint much easier
    - Update connections of catenary poles when adjacent rails are placed or removed (also helps with blueprinting)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 19.02.2024
  Locale:
    - Added Ukrainian translation, thanks to MetenBouldry

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 19.02.2024
  Features:
    - Added sounds & effects for damaging, destroying, and running into catenary poles & transformers
    - Added corpses, water reflections, and resistances for catenary poles & transformers
  Bugfixes:
    - Made internal entites immune to fire, preventing weird behavior and crashes
    - Rewrote some locomotive update logic to prevent electric interfaces from being left behind when transformers are removed or destroyed
    - Fixed a floating point precision error that caused locomotive energy buffers to not completly fill until it tried to move
    - Fixed a catastrophic typo that prevented back_mover locomotives from being updated or iterated properly
    - i honestly have no idea how that one didn't cause a single crash in any of my testing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 18.02.2024
  Features:
    - Reworked internal catenary pole logic, making them behave more intuitively (rotatable & blueprintable)
  Graphics:
    - Added better placeholder graphics for catenary poles & transformers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.4
Date: 04.12.2023
  Features:
    - Automatically generate electric-energy-interfaces for electric locomotives
    - Simplify some internal logic, slightly improving performance
  Bugfixes:
    - Handle on_entity_cloned to fix a crash when a locomotive was cloned
    - Fix a crash when removing a train that just changed state
    - Create data for existing locomotive entities that were not previously electric
  Compatibility:
    - Now compatable with Space Exploration's spaceships due to the on_entity_cloned fix. Space elevators already worked fine
    - The internal rails of SE's Space elevator are now powered (prevents a brief "train out of fuel" warning)
    - Compatability with SE Space Trains, makes them electric and removes the battery packs (both optional)
    - Recipe compatability with Brevven's resource mods (Lead, Tin, & Aluminum)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
Date: 20.11.2023
  Features:
    - Distribute train updates across multiple ticks, updating each train every 6 ticks (rate is configurable)
    - Correctly unpower rails when a catenary pole is removed
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when LuaTrains were removed/created due to locomotive prototypes being removed
    - Fixed a filename issue with a wire sprite (?)
  Compatibility:
    - Marked catenary poles & transformer as not movable by Picker Dollies
    - Recipe consistency with AAI Industry
    - Move our items into the 'rail' subgroup that Space Exploration creates

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.2
Date: 18.11.2023
  Features:
    - Only locomotives that are accelerating consume power (including in manual mode)
    - Connecting catenary lines around curves
    - Multiple transformers per network, works with multi-surface electric networks
    - Rail power visualization & shortcut to toggle it
    - Update all locomotives in a train as a group

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 17.07.2023
  Features:
    - Electric locomotives (use power from catenary lines & disable when no power)
    - Basic catenary line functionality (doesn't work around curves yet)
    - Catenary line transformer (core entity of a catenary network)
    - Technologies and recipes for vanilla Factorio
  Graphics:
    - Lovely placeholder graphics by yours truly ;)
  Locale:
    - Added English translation
