# Overhead Electrification (Realistic Electric Trains)
Adds electric trains that are powered by overhead catenary lines. Designed to use minimal scripting for maximum performance. Integrates smoothly into vanilla gameplay & progression, and (will have) technology/recipe compatibility with various overhaul mods.  

Graphics are placeholder (obviously), I plan to create my own (including the locomotive), but if you feel like making some assets that'd be cool!  
Translations are also welcome, although the mod is in alpha so the stuff you need to translate might change; check back later once the mod is fully released.  

## planned features:
- catenary poles with built-in signals, double catenary poles
- regenerative braking (wow!)
- overlay for viewing what rails are powered
- compat with various overhaul mods:
  - Space Exploration (space elevator, space rails, spaceship)
  - [x] AAI Industry (adjust recipes)
  - Krastorio (i haven't played it but i've heard it changes vehicle stats significantly)
  - BZ materials (adjust recipes to use the materials)
  - planetfall's resource mods
  - Nullius
  - idk maybe Bobs/Angels if somebody asks nicely
- compat with train mods:
  - SE Space Trains (make them electric instead of battery powered)
  - Renai Transportation (make sure there's no crashes or whatever when using train ramps)
  - other popular transit/train related mods?
- other compat:
  - [x] Picker Dollies (make transformer & catenary poles not movable (it doesn't work anyways but gives a weird error))
  - [Fluidic Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FluidicPower)? that'd be cool
