oe-train-update-rate=Train update rate
[mod-setting-description]
oe-train-update-rate=Updates trains every n ticks. Defaults to every 6 ticks, i.e. 10 times per second.\nA larger value improves performance, at the cost of reduced power consumption accuracy.\nTrain updates are spread across multiple ticks to prevent performace spikes.
